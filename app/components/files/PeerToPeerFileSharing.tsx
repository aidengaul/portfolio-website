            <p className="max-w-4xl">
                This project is a peer-to-peer file-sharing system that I developed as part of a networking course at the University of Florida. Each peer runs as a standalone process, initially configured via a shared config file that specifies hostnames, ports, and whether a peer initially holds the target file. Using a custom file-reader module, each peer loads global settings and peer data, then spins up a server listener thread and a client thread for every other peer.
                <br />
                <br />
                Peers perform a TCP handshake, exchange bitfield messages to advertise which file chunks they possess, and negotiate choking/unchoking based on download rates (including an optimistic unchoke). Whenever a peer acquires a new chunk, it broadcasts a `have` message; interested peers request missing pieces one at a time. A BitField abstraction tracks chunk ownership, and a ConnectionThread object manages message framing, I/O streams, and download-rate calculation. Once all chunks are collected, each peerâ€™s reassembles the complete file locally.
                <br />
                <br />
                Additionally, to aid in debugging and performance analysis, I built a logger that records every connection event, choke/unchoke decision, and piece download.
